# **1-Introduction**
This project shows the deployment and results of a machine learning process made to identify whether news articles are REAL or FAKE. The study has a mix of  AI technology with human behavioral m


**Detection and Precision:** Building a technical model optimized for accuracy.


**User Education:** Helping users improve their perception of honesty online.


**Vulnerability Analysis:** Studying how different demographic groups react to various news forms.


**Trust Assessment:** Researching human trust in AI versus other humans regarding false news.



# **2- Methodology**

**Data Source:** A labeled dataset of news articles acquired from Kaggle.


**Preprocessing:** Included lower-casing, removing URLs, and eliminating stop words.


**Model:** Utilized a Passive Aggressive Classifier (PAC) for high efficiency in processing sparse text.


**Feature Engineering:** Applied TF-IDF Vectorizer with bigram extraction.

# **3- Performance Analysis**
The model achieved high accuracy and reliability in testing:


**Accuracy:** 94.16%.


**Precision (REAL):** 0.94 (94% of articles labeled REAL were truly real).


**AUC Value:** 0.98, ensuring the authenticity of AI trust markers.

# **4- Key Findings**
The model identifies truthfulness based on specific weighted patterns:


**REAL News Indicators:** Professional attribution words like "said" and "state".


**FAKE News Indicators:** Sensationalistic or click-to-share terms like "October" and "share".

# **5- Future Work**

**Deployment:** Integrating the model into a web service using the saved .pkl file.


**External Surveys:** Implementing human studies to further explore Trust and Vulnerability variables.
