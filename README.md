# 📰 Detecting and Mitigating Fake News
### An AI Framework for Truth and Trust

This project isn't just a news classifier; it’s a tool built to understand how humans interact with misinformation. I developed a high-precision pipeline to help users learn the "patterns of fake news" and to test whether people trust AI more than human experts.

## 🚀 Key Achievements
* **Accuracy:** 94.16%
* **Precision:** 0.94 (Crucial for avoiding false censorship)
* **Interpretability:** Used model weights to identify markers like "SHOCKING!" vs "OFFICIAL STATEMENT."

## 📁 Repository Structure
* `detector_model.ipynb`: Full implementation from data cleaning to model training.
* `fake_news_detector_pipeline.pkl`: The "saved brain" of the AI, ready for deployment.
* `Fake_News_Project_Report.docx`: Detailed analysis of the project's behavioral science goals.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Python** (Pandas, Scikit-learn, NLTK)
- **Passive Aggressive Classifier** (Optimized for text speed)
- **TF-IDF Vectorization** (Captures the context of words)
